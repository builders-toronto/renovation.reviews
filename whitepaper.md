## 1. Executive Summary

**Renovation ($RENO)** is a Solana-based meme coin designed to reward and incentivize community engagement within the [Renovation.Reviews](https://renovation.reviews) platform, a web forum focused on home renovation insights, tips, and success stories. The coin functions both as a community rewards mechanism and as an investment fund for active members. By awarding $RENO to contributors who share high-quality content, the Renovation platform encourages continuous, in-depth community participation—thereby elevating the platform’s value, trust, and reach.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The Home Renovation Community Challenge

Home renovation forums rely heavily on user-generated content—such as how-to guides, product recommendations, and troubleshooting advice. Despite their critical role, contributors often receive only intangible benefits (e.g., recognition, likes, or community goodwill). Over time, many knowledgeable contributors may become less motivated to share content if they see no clear benefit beyond a digital pat on the back.

### 2.2 Why a Token?

By introducing **$RENO** as a digital asset, we add tangible value to community contributions. Rewarding active participants with a liquid, tradable token:

- Incentivizes continued knowledge-sharing and high-quality forum posts.
- Strengthens community engagement and loyalty.
- Provides additional benefits through an investment fund mechanism for ongoing platform development and user empowerment.

## 3. Vision and Mission

**Vision:** To build the most comprehensive, user-driven knowledge repository in the home renovation space while seamlessly integrating a rewarding and empowering financial layer for participants.

**Mission:**

- **Reward:** Provide immediate, tangible recognition to active contributors.  
- **Empower:** Enable forum members to grow their $RENO holdings through staking, trading, and community investment.  
- **Expand:** Promote global adoption of $RENO as a utility token with real-world benefits, bridging the gap between DIY renovation experts, hobbyists, and professional contractors.
