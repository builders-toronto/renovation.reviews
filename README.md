## ✨ What Makes Us Different?

| 🔍 Problem | ✨ Our Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Fake or paid reviews distort decision‑making. | **Proof‑of‑Contribution Rewards** – members earn $RENO for posting verifiable, high‑quality reviews, guides, and answers. |
| Expert contributors often burn out with no upside. | **Stake‑to‑Earn Buy‑Back Loop** – the platform swaps a share of ad & affiliate revenue for $RENO each week and auto‑streams those tokens to stakers. |
| Traditional forums rely purely on ads. | **Multi‑Stream Monetization** – escrow marketplace, AR visualiser, content boosts, and NFT plan sales—all routed through the $RENO token economy. |
| Inflation erodes long‑term value. | **Deflation‑by‑Design** – every boost or premium‑tool fee burns 100 % of the $RENO spent, tightening supply over time. |
