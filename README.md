## ✨ What Makes Us Different?

| 🔍 Problem | ✨ Our Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Fake or paid reviews distort decision-making. | **Proof-of-Contribution Rewards** – Members earn $RENO for posting verifiable, high-quality reviews, guides, and answers. |
| Expert contributors often burn out with no upside. | **Stake-to-Earn Revenue Share** – Lock $RENO and receive a share of ad revenue, marketplace fees, and premium-tool sales. |
| Traditional forums rely purely on ads. | **Multi-Stream Monetization** – Marketplace escrow, AR visualizer, content boosts, and NFT plan sales—all routed through the $RENO token economy. |

## 🌍 Our Vision & Mission
**Vision:** A transparent, community-owned knowledge base that powers smarter, safer renovations worldwide.  
**Mission:** *Reward · Empower · Expand* – rewarding contributors, empowering homeowners, and expanding renovation knowledge for all.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Contribute-to-Earn** – Get automatic $RENO drops for new tutorials, before/after showcases, and verified answers.  
- **Stake-to-Earn** – Deposit $RENO into the staking vault and collect weekly revenue share (target 8–15 % APR).  
- **Marketplace & Escrow** – Hire contractors or sell 3-D floor-plan NFTs with milestone-based SPL escrow.  
- **Boost & Burn** – Spend $RENO to highlight your post; 100 % of the spend is permanently burned, making every boost deflationary.  
- **DAO Governance** – 1 $RENO = 1 vote on treasury spend, new feature proposals, and grant approvals.  
- **Premium Creator Program** – Hold ≥ 100 k $RENO + verification to unlock paid masterclasses (70 / 30 split in your favor).
