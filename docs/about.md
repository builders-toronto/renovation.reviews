# Renovation ($RENO)

## What Is the Project About?

Renovation ($RENO) is a **Solana SPL meme‑utility token** powering the Renovation.Reviews ecosystem—a cross‑channel content flywheel that reaches Google Search, YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, X, and more.  
- **Create‑to‑Earn:** Contributors earn $RENO whenever their renovation tutorials, reviews, or memes climb SERPs or social feeds.  
- **Stake‑to‑Earn:** Ad, affiliate, and marketplace revenue generated by that traffic flows directly back to stakers.  
- **Deflation:** Premium tools, boosted posts, and DAO votes trigger automatic token burns, tightening supply as the platform grows.  
With a fixed, immutable contract and capped supply, every uptick in traffic translates into higher token demand and yield.

## What Makes $Renovation Unique?

1. **Crypto‑Powered Reviews**  
   Traditional renovation forums offer karma or badges; Renovation.Reviews pays tangible, on‑chain rewards.

2. **Stake‑to‑Revenue Loop**  
   Ad impressions, affiliate sales, and marketplace fees are program‑matically routed to a staking pool—holders literally earn from the eyeballs their content attracts.

3. **Multi‑Network Reach**  
   SEO‑optimised articles, vertical‑video snippets, and Pinterest infographics feed each other, compounding visibility across channels.

4. **Hard‑Capped, Deflationary Supply**  
   No hidden mints, no inflation. Burns from premium features permanently reduce circulating supply, aligning long‑term holders with platform success.
