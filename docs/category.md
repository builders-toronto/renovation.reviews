Renovation ($RENO) sits at the intersection of **social engagement** and **decentralized finance**, embodying the core principles of SocialFi. Within the Renovation.Reviews ecosystem, users don’t just post or comment—they **earn real value** for their contributions.

- **Create-to-Earn:** High-quality guides, reviews, tutorials, and expert Q&A are rewarded with $RENO tokens, encouraging meaningful and helpful content.  
- **Stake-to-Earn:** Ad, affiliate, and marketplace revenue generated by community-driven content is distributed to stakers, turning platform engagement into a sustainable yield model.  
- **Deflationary Mechanics:** Premium tools and content boosts consume $RENO via burns, reducing supply and strengthening the token economy.  

This blend of **content-driven growth** and **financial incentives** perfectly aligns Renovation.Reviews with the broader SocialFi narrative. By empowering creators, experts, and enthusiasts alike, $RENO transforms a traditional renovation forum into a self-sustaining, value-sharing ecosystem.
